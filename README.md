# Emo Nite Trivia
Class repository for WS300-Platt College San Diego

This is the repository dedicated to work associated with the WS300 Javascript class I am taking at Platt College San Diego.

Currently the files represented are for code challenges and my final project for the class.
The final project is creating a personality style quiz aimed at being a trivia night game centered around Emo/Pop Punk music.
